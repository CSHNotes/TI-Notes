# Business Case and Design for RTD

* RTD - Real Time Data

* recall that convergence, VoIP and telephony injection do not simply refer to voice
	* video conference
	* message
* so you must investigate several factors when considering VoIP
	* current state of the network
	* training/current skillsets
	* cost
* key areas
	* business environment
	* network environment
	* implementation plan/scenario

## Business Environment

* can VoIP help?
* philosophy
* competition?
* type
* increase in efficiency
* cost/benefit analysis
* improve service
* impact on apps
* better/easier management
* compliance
* monitoring

### Business Cost

* VoIP breaks the way we normally think
	* software deployment
	* often not tied to expensive hardware
	* dev environment
	* converged net
	* staffing and training are reduced
* upfront costs
	* equipment
	* consulting and design
	* training
	* licensing
	* support
* costs can be controlled by managing the deployment
	* incremental change
	* negotiation
	* leasing/renting
	* hosting
* cost models - how do we pay for this?
	1. per user - (total cost) / # users
		* determine what departments are going to pay
		* how long before it pays for itself
	2. actual consumption
		* historical data to assign values to departments
		* can mean
			* bandwidth
			* system time
			* support/trouble calls
			* no. of calls
			* off hook time
* don't forget about misc costs and overheard which cannot be attributed to any particular entity
	* floor space
	* electrical
	* heating/cooling
* Previously forklift changes were not considered beneficial due to lost dollars
	* tolls change this

Where are the savings?
* bills, especially tolls

But one of the hardest things to do is identify the current costs
* Are the savings ongoing or one time only?
* Do I get a boost in productivity?
* Does the timing work?
* Are you at risk?
